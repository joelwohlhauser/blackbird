# Blackbird docs

Start with [Install Blackbird](./user/install.md), [Updating Blackbird](./user/updating.md), the [FAQ](./user/faq.md), and the [Blackbird feature map](../README.md#what-is-custom-in-blackbird).

The guides below are inherited from T3 Code and remain useful for shared features and architecture. They may use T3 Code names, shortcuts, or service commands. Blackbird's README takes precedence for its custom behavior. T3 Connect, upstream app-store builds, and upstream CLI distribution are not Blackbird release channels.

## Working on Blackbird

Start with the [development runbook](./operations/development.md) and [desktop releases](./operations/blackbird-releases.md).

Internal notes preserve architectural decisions, constraints, and implementation traps that the source alone does not explain. Most code changes do not need an internal documentation update. Follow the [documentation rules](../AGENTS.md#documentation) before adding one.

- [Architecture overview](./internals/overview.md)
- [Glossary](./internals/glossary.md)
- [Connection runtime](./internals/connection-runtime.md)
- [Providers](./internals/providers.md)
- [Adding a provider](./internals/adding-a-provider.md)
- [Pull request file revisions](./internals/pull-request-file-revisions.md)
- [Model classification](./internals/model-manifest.md)
- [Remote environments](./internals/remote.md)
- [Server updates](./internals/server-updates.md)
- [Resource telemetry](./internals/resource-telemetry.md)
- [Environment auth](./internals/environment-auth.md)
- [T3 Connect](./internals/t3-connect.md)
- [Assistant citations](./internals/assistant-citations.md)
- [Mobile navigation](./internals/mobile-navigation.md)
- [Mobile development lifecycle](./internals/mobile-development.md)
- [Terminal runtime](./internals/terminal-runtime.md)
- [Devices](./internals/devices.md)
- [Voice input](./internals/voice-input.md)

### Upstream reference runbooks

- [T3 Connect setup](./operations/connect-setup.md)
- [Upstream release process](./operations/release.md)
- [Observability](./operations/observability.md)
- [Relay observability](./operations/relay-observability.md)
- [Mobile app store screenshots](./operations/mobile-app-store-screenshots.md)
